== Methods of Deploying an API Proxy

An API proxy provides a way of separating your customer-facing API from the backend systems and services that are part of the API implementation. These backend systemscan be external systems or Mule applications that are running on a Mule runtime. By default, if you are using versions 3.8, 3.9 and 4.x, you do not have to deploy an API proxy to make an API publicly available. However, if your Mule application does not have Autodiscovery configured, you must deploy an API proxy to expose the Mule application via an API.
