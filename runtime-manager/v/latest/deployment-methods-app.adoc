= Methods of Deploying a Mule Application

This topic lists the different methods of deploying Mule applications, APIs, and API proxies in Anypoint Platform. 

Anypoint Platform provides multiple tools for designing APIs and Mule applications. After desiging an API or Mule application, you need a way to test it, and ultimately, make it accessible to users in a production environment.

Deployment refers to the process of moving  from your development environment to a Mule runtime so that they are available for testing or production. Within Anypoint Platform there are three types of resources you can deploy: 

* Mule applications
* APIs
* API proxies

Anypoint Platform provides multiple ways of deploying Mule applications, APIs, and API proxies. The exact method you use to deploy depends partially on whether you are deploying to a sandbox or production environment and on whether you need to automate the deployment process.

The following sections describe different ways of deploying a Mule application within Anypoint Platform.

== Design Center

Enables you to deploy directly to CloudHub. You can specify the environment where you want to deploy. In a normal workflow, this would be a sandbox environment used for testing your application. See link:/design-center/v/1.0/promote-app-prod-env-design-center[To Deploy an App (Design Center)] for more information.

== Anypoint Studio

Anypoint Studio provides a built-in Mule runtime environment. Deploy your Mule application to this environment for local testing during development.

Additionally, you can link:/anypoint-studio/v/7.1/deploy-mule-application-task[Deploy a Mule Application to CloudHub]. 

== Runtime Manager

CloudHub, Hybrid, PCE, PCF

== CloudHub API

== Anypoint Platform CLI

== Mule Maven Plugin

== Standalone Mule
